Everything extends "Component"
Component is the building block of React (then you pass in props "properties": either functions, elements...), and
Everything is basically a component

States are properties of the components: And can represent anything in that's declared within this.state ={ } (<- Delcared in constructor!)
Basically all the objects that you want to dynamically change on the web, you want to put in the state

Rendering: React re-renders the virtual DOM (only the differences - super efficient!) on state changes
