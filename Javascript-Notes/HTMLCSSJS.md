HTML is the Skeleton, CSS is the skin, JS is the behaviour.

With HTML + CSS you build staitc websites that don't change.

With JS you can introduce some logic to make things update.

With C++, Python, etc. you build a server that provides data/listens for clients.

The data that the server provides to the client is actually the bundle of the webpage HTML, CSS, JS.

So the back end languages execute the logic of the webpage and send the result to the client, since the browser cannot do it.
