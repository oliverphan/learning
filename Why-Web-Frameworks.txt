You need web frameworks (essentially packages) to take out the overhead of the architecture:
+ Accessing databases, handling HTTP Methods (get/post)
+ Mapping  requested URLs to the HTTP codes meant to handle them (routing)
+ Creating requested HTML dynamically & inject calculated values/information retrived from a database (Views)
+ Overall: Hiding/providing overhead boilerplate & infrastructural code related to handling HTTP requests/responses (how much depends on framework)

Workflow of Server side non-JS Framework: Receiving HTTP requests, dispatch code generating HTML, creates HTTP response with content


Web frameworks make it easier to build basic backend logic
+ Mapping URLs to chunks of code
+ Dealing with databases
+ Generating HTML Files
