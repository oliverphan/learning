You need web frameworks (essentially packages) to take out the overhead of the architecture:
+ Accessing databases, handling HTTP Methods (get/post)
+ Mapping  requested URLs to the HTTP codes meant to handle them (routing)
+ Creating requested HTML dynamically & inject calculated values/information retrived from a database?
+ Overall: Hiding/providing overhead boilerplate & infrastructural code related to handling HTTP requests/responses (how much depends on framework)
