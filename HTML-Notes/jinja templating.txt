python manage.py startapp "name"

install the app in the mysite "settings.py"

mysite\urls.py put in the name of the app, then update the url path based on r'^$'

"newapp"\urls.py update the imports - delete admin & return views
from . import views
url(r'^$', views.index, name='index')

"newapp"\views.py update the index function
def index(request {required parameter}):
	return render(request, 'newapp\htmlFile.html'{location of html template you want to render})
Note: render looks into a 'templates' directory - so put your html targets into templates (probably want sub folders within them that are labeled)

In addition with your target html, need a header.html, home.html

<!DOCTYPE html>
header.html
{% block content %}
{% end block %}

home.html 
starts with the templates {% extends "newapp\header.html" %} <- note how for other apps can extend this header even if it's in the templates folder of another app

{% block content %}

<p> your content goes here to insert </p>

{% include 'newapp\includes\htmlsnippet.html' %} <!-- Make sure to have this in another directory -->

{% end block %}


htmlsnipper.html <!-- Same kind of syntax! -->
{% block content %}
<p> Hi! </p>
{% end block %}
